# Technical Challenge from fliQt

# Designing a HR system API
Since this project is built for an interview, I wanna ensure that we focus on the most core part, which is demonstrating my technical skills. I have marked some of the functional requirements below and tried to make the project smaller. Perhaps we can discuss the items that were deleted at some point.

## Functional requirements
- There are 3 different roles of characters using this system: candidate, interviewer, HR.
- Candidates can search for jobs and filter by title, job description, salary range and job type.
- Candidates can check their application status.
- ~~HR can use the system to manage schedules and status.~~
- HR can manage applications from candidates.
- A job can be created/updated, or closed by HR.
- ~~The system can organize interview schedule.~~

## Non-functional requirements
- Since resumes contain highly confidential data, interviewers and HR must pass the 2FA before downloading them.
- ~~Analysing resumes and making a score for each candidates.~~
- Records every operation for tracking purposes.
